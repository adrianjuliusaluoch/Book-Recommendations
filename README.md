# Book-Recommendations
## Python
### Basics
- [Python Tricks: A Buffet of Awesome Python Features (Books)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1775093301/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
by Bader, Dan
    - Great mid-level intro book to explaining all of the features you should know in Python.  A great go-to once you 
    have all of the basics down in Python.  Super easy and fun to read.

### Machine Learning
- [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492032646/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
by Géron, Aurélien
    - Mid to advanced-level "intro" book to machine learning.  Really focuses on the principles behind machine
    learning techniques.  Sometimes it can be a bit to advanced for my liking, but overall a must read if getting into
    Machine Learning.  Also provides you with a ton of python notebooks to see code examples.
    
## Power BI / Power Query
- [Power Pivot and Power BI: The Excel User's Guide to DAX, Power Query, Power BI & Power Pivot in Excel 2010-2016 The Excel User's Guide to DAX, Power Query, Power BI & Power Pivot in Excel 2010-2016](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1615470395/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
by Collie, Rob and Singh, Avichal
    - Entry level book for basic functionality within Power BI (How to organize data, how to import it, and basics on how to 
    clean it).  A lot of info is covered on DAX (language for data manipulation within Power BI on the front end).  I 
    feel understanding the M-Language (language used by Power Query)) is more important for my need (i.e. data cleaning).
    - Recommended Readings:
        - Ch 4, 10, 20 have the most informative sections on properly loading data
        - Ch 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18  are also great chapters to read
        - All the other chapters focus heavily on DAX

- [M Is for (Data) Monkey: A Guide to the M Language in Excel Power Query](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Monkey-Guide-Language-Excel/dp/1615470344/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=power+query&qid=1582564028&sr=8-3)  
by Puls, Ken and Escobar, Miguel
    - Entry to mid-level book focused on Power Query (i.e. “Macros” on back end that import and clean the data).
    Don't be confused the whole book isn't all about the M Language, it walks you through how to set up queries using 
    the GUI interface of Power Query and then it also explains the code behind it.  If you are thinking about 
    automating a data cleanse this is for you.
    - Recommended Readings:
        - Ch 0 to 17.  Later chapters go into advanced detail that may not be necessary

## Excel / VBA
- [Excel Basics to Blackbelt](https://www.amazon.com/Excel-Basics-Blackbelt-Elliot-Bendoly/dp/1107625521/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=excek+bendoly&qid=1582601196&s=books&sr=1-1-spell)  
by Bendoly, Elliot
    - Entry to mid-level book on everything from Excel basics (literally the basics) all the way to coding in VBA.  If
    you use Excel in your job you need to read this book.  I use Dr. Bendoly's tactics every single time that I use
    Excel.  Dr. B has a way of breaking down the most complicated topics into a simple manner that can be understood by all.
    I took his class while getting my MBA and he was my main inspiration for getting into Data Analytics.
